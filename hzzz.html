            <li> The environment is becoming a popular topic in the media more and more. We hear daily about plastic pollution, what it does to our nature, we hear about destroyed coral reefs and about disappearing rain-forests. It seems like we are powerless against it all, that everything has gone too far and there is no hope. However, small actions taken by many people can have a big impact.
